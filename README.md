# Toolbox

You can download the installer for the MEA-Toolbox in the release section. 
Please download the source code zip file.
When unzipped you will have the installer together with the manual. 
During the installation you will install the MATLAB 2018b runtime aswell as the toolbox requires it.
Once installed and opened you will see a terminal window open.
Please do not close this terminal window but just minimize it as it will display any error you might encounter and this will greatly help us to fix any problems that might occur.

The link below gives you access to a google drive with 3 different test data files that can be used for testing purposes.
