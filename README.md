# MEA-ToolBox

You can download the installer for the MEA-Toolbox.
There are two versions, one with the MATLAB 2018B runtime and one without.
If you do not have MATLAB or a matlab version that is not 2018b, please download the version with the runtime.

Another option is to download the runtime from MATLAB (https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)
Please make sure to download the 2018B version and then you can use the installer without the runtime. 

During the installation you will install the MATLAB 2018b runtime aswell as the toolbox requires it.
Once installed and opened you will see a terminal window open.
Please do not close this terminal window but just minimize it as it will display any error you might encounter and this will greatly help us to fix any problems that might occur.

When using the source code, the main script of the MEAToolbox is the Main_Menu_Toolbox script.
For help, please look at the manual or mail m.h.y.hu@lumc.nl
